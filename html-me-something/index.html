                    Doctor Who is a sci-fi action adventure show that originally began in
                    1963 and ran until 1989. In 2005 the show was revived for an entirely 
                    new generation. Each episode takes you on an adventure through time and space. 
                    The Doctor has companions that travel with him/her and help to keep him grounded.
                    One of the unique things that helps the show to be able to run so long is the 
                    fact that the Doctor can regenerate. Regeneration happens when the Doctor dies,
                    when that happens the body goes through a regeneration and starts over with a 
                    completely new and different body. If you can get past the cheesiness of the
                    first few episodes you're in for the ride of your life.

                        Doctor Who chronicled the adventures of an eccentric time-traveling scientist from the remote planet Gallifrey, 
                        home of the Time Lords. The Doctor, a Time Lord himself, traveled through time and 
                        space in his unique craft, the TARDIS, an acronym for Time and Relative Dimensions in 
                        Space. With an interior larger than its exterior, the TARDIS could take on various 
                        shapes to blend into its environment. Although capable of whisking the Doctor and his 
                        passengers to any time and any place in the universe, the craft was frequently parked 
                        on Earth in the form of a blue police box. Whether in England or in the far reaches of 
                        space, the Doctor and his colleagues battled a multitude of evils,including robots, 
                        monsters, and a twisted Time Lord. Certain adversaries recurred throughout the series, 
                        notably the Daleks, genocidal aliens armoured in robotlike suits who sought the 
                        extermination of life-forms inferior to themselves.

                            The term "companion" refers to a character who travels with, or shares the adventures of, 
                            the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate. 
                            They provide the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion 
                            character often furthers the story by asking questions and getting into trouble, or by 
                            helping, rescuing, or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character 
                            by the show's producers and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen 
                            fictional terminology. Until the modern revival of the series in 2005, the term was rarely 
                            used on-screen. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as his "friends" or 
                            "assistants"; the British press have also used the latter term
